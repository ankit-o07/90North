### Using Daphne for ASGI
To deploy this application in a production environment with **Daphne**:
1. Install Daphne:
   ```bash
   pip install daphne

2. Update the deployment server to run Daphne instead of the default Django server:
   ```bash
   daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 your_project_name.asgi:application
   ```

3. Configure your production server (e.g., Nginx) to proxy requests to Daphne.
